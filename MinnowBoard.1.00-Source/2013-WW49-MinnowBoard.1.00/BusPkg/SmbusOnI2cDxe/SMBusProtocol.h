/**
  Executes an SMBUS block process call command.

  Executes an SMBUS block process call command on the SMBUS device specified by SmBusAddress.
  The SMBUS slave address, SMBUS command, and SMBUS length fields of SmBusAddress are required.
  Bytes are written to the SMBUS from WriteBuffer.  Bytes are then read from the SMBUS into ReadBuffer.
  If Status is not NULL, then the status of the executed command is returned in Status.
  It is the caller's responsibility to make sure ReadBuffer is large enough for the total number of bytes read.
  SMBUS supports a maximum transfer size of 32 bytes, so Buffer does not need to be any larger than 32 bytes.
  If Length in SmBusAddress is zero or greater than 32, then ASSERT().
  If WriteBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If ReadBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If any reserved bits of SmBusAddress are set, then ASSERT().

  @param  This          Address of an EFI_SMBUS_PROTOCOL structure.
  @param  SmBusAddress  Address that encodes the SMBUS Slave Address,
                        SMBUS Command, SMBUS Data Length, and PEC.
  @param  WriteBuffer   Pointer to the buffer of bytes to write to the SMBUS.
  @param  ReadBuffer    Pointer to the buffer of bytes to read from the SMBUS.
  @param  Status        Return status for the executed command.
                        This is an optional parameter and may be NULL.
                        RETURN_TIMEOUT A timeout occurred while executing the SMBUS command.
                        RETURN_DEVICE_ERROR  The request was not completed because a failure
                        reflected in the Host Status Register bit.  Device errors are a result
                        of a transaction collision, illegal command field, unclaimed cycle
                        (host initiated), or bus errors (collisions).

/**
  Executes an SMBUS write data word command.

  Executes an SMBUS write data word command on the SMBUS device specified by SmBusAddress.
  The 16-bit value specified by Value is written.
  Only the SMBUS slave address and SMBUS command fields of SmBusAddress are required.
  Value is returned.
  If Status is not NULL, then the status of the executed command is returned in Status.
  If Length in SmBusAddress is not zero, then ASSERT().
  If any reserved bits of SmBusAddress are set, then ASSERT().

  @param  This          Address of an EFI_SMBUS_PROTOCOL structure.
  @param  SmBusAddress  Address that encodes the SMBUS Slave Address,
                        SMBUS Command, SMBUS Data Length, and PEC.
  @param  Value         The 16-bit value to write.
  @param  Status        Return status for the executed command.
                        This is an optional parameter and may be NULL.
                        RETURN_SUCCESS The SMBUS command was executed.
                        RETURN_TIMEOUT A timeout occurred while executing the SMBUS command.
                        RETURN_DEVICE_ERROR  The request was not completed because a failure
                        reflected in the Host Status Register bit.  Device errors are a result
                        of a transaction collision, illegal command field, unclaimed cycle
                        (host initiated), or bus errors (collisions).
                        RETURN_CRC_ERROR  The checksum is not correct (PEC is incorrect)
                        RETURN_UNSUPPORTED  The SMBus operation is not supported.

  @return The parameter of Value.
