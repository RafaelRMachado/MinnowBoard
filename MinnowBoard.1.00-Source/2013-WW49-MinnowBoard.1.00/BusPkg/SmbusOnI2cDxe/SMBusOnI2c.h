  Executes an SMBUS block process call command.

  Executes an SMBUS block process call command on the SMBUS device specified by SmBusAddress.
  The SMBUS slave address, SMBUS command, and SMBUS length fields of SmBusAddress are required.
  Bytes are written to the SMBUS from WriteBuffer.  Bytes are then read from the SMBUS into ReadBuffer.
  If Status is not NULL, then the status of the executed command is returned in Status.
  It is the caller's responsibility to make sure ReadBuffer is large enough for the total number of bytes read.
  SMBUS supports a maximum transfer size of 32 bytes, so Buffer does not need to be any larger than 32 bytes.
  If Length in SmBusAddress is zero or greater than 32, then ASSERT().
  If WriteBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If ReadBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If any reserved bits of SmBusAddress are set, then ASSERT().
