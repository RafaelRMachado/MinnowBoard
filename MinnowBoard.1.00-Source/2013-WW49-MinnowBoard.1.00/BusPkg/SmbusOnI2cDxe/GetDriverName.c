/**
  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the driver.

  This function retrieves the user readable name of a driver in the form of a
  Unicode string. If the driver specified by This has a user readable name in
  the language specified by Language, then a pointer to the driver name is
  returned in DriverName, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned. If the driver specified
  by This does not support the language specified by Language,
  then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.

  @param [in] pThis             A pointer to the EFI_COMPONENT_NAME2_PROTOCOL or
                                EFI_COMPONENT_NAME_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param [in] pLanguage         A pointer to a Null-terminated ASCII string
                                array indicating the language. This is the
                                language of the driver name that the caller is
                                requesting, and it must match one of the
                                languages specified in SupportedLanguages. The
                                number of languages supported by a driver is up
                                to the driver writer. Language is specified
                                in RFC 3066 or ISO 639-2 language code format.
  @param [out] ppDriverName     A pointer to the Unicode string to return.
                                This Unicode string is the name of the
                                driver specified by This in the language
                                specified by Language.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The Unicode string for the Driver specified by
                                This and the language specified by Language was
                                returned in DriverName.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Language is NULL.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER DriverName is NULL.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The driver specified by This does not support
                                the language specified by Language.
